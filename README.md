# TrainScheduler

- The purpose of the Train Scheduler is two-fold (from my learning perspective):

1. To demonstrate how to manipulate Firebase and retrieve data
2. For me - another area of interest is to understand how to efficiently utilize databases - my guess is that Firebase is what is known as a NO-SQL database (I am not sure if that is the correct word but I feel I am close) - therefore some thought regarding how the data is structured (one way I will explore is to organize the items by destinations - this might reduce seek time

The other aspect is to efficiently handle computation - again, based on what we learnt in class - it doesnt make sense to send calculated items over the network to the database - better to calculate them in the browser (if not very complex)

Another things that was very satisfying for me was the way I have produced the html table - this is through a code that goes through an object, understands its keys, and automatically adjusts table headers and columns.
